# from_scratch_models
Few examples of building simple models from scratch. These include classifiers fon tabular data using pytorch, collaborative filtering models for movie recommenders etc.The goal of these notebooks is to provide a strong intuition on the basic principles behind these models and how to practically use frameworks like pytorch and fastai to translate this intution into code. Mostly based on ithe book Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch, and notebooks from Jeremy Howard: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/linear-model-and-neural-net-from-scratch, https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/why-you-should-use-a-framework
